Characterized by<br />abstract thought<br />understanding<br />communication<br />reasoning<br />planning<br />emotional intelligence<br />problem solving<br />“Plus c¸a change, plus c’est la mˆeme chose”<br />It is found in all living things; bacteria, plants, animals and<br />humans. It has evolved from primitive to more complex forms.<br /><br />AI Paradigm ! Behaviourism<br />Intelligence is determined only by behaviour within an<br />environment. The brain is a black box, having senses as inputs<br />and behaviour as output.<br /><br />Achievments<br />Eliza was the closest computer program to pass the Turing<br />test. It mimicked a psychoanalyst rephrasing questions<br />back to you.<br />Expert systems = database of facts + inference rules<br />(medical field, solve mathematical theorems).<br />IBM’s “Deep Blue” beats Gary Kasparov (famous world<br />chess champion).<br />Asserts that with sufficient processing power and enough<br />memory ! “thinking” will occur.<br /><br />Differences between brains and computers<br />Computer programmed flawless CPU<br />Brain self-learning tolerant no “CPU”<br /><br />Chinese Room Argument<br />Figure: If you can carry on an intelligent conversation using pieces of<br />paper slid under a door, does this imply that someone or something<br />on the other side understands what you are saying? - John Searle<br /><br />concept first proposed by Alan Turing<br />consists mainly of feed-forward connections<br />in brains feedback connections exceed the feed-forward<br />connections by a factor of 10<br />big tendency to disregard time as a factor<br /><br />The Human Brain<br />Neuroscience was focusing on mental disorders, mapping<br />the brain and produced a lot of data but no theory.<br />Visual area of blind people gets activated when they read<br />Braille even if it involves touch.<br />A blind man was able to see with a device that translated<br />video signal into pressure sensations on the tongue.<br />A little girls brain suffered a hemispherectomy operation<br />because of a tumour and her brain was able to rewire itself<br />in a couple of days and be normal (neuro-plasticity).<br /><br />Mountcastle proposition<br />Neocortex is uniform in structure and it’s using the same<br />algorithm which is independent of any particular sense.<br />All input information comes in spatial-temporal patterns on<br />the axons and it’s the same regardless of the sense.<br /><br />Memory<br />Neurons are quite slow (200 Hz) in comparison with a CPU<br />which is 5 millions times faster (1 GHz).<br />The 100-step-rule says that a 100 step problem cannot be<br />solved in less than 100 steps even if it’s parallel.<br />Brain is massively parallel but also serial. The brain<br />doesn’t compute, it’s just searching the memory.<br />Distinguishing images of cats and dogs: less than a<br />second for the brain, almost impossible for a computer.<br />Brain Memory Characteristics<br />Associative memory of temporal sequences of patterns:<br />memory can recall the whole sequence from a part.<br />Patterns are stored in a hierarchy of invariant<br />representations (able to handle variation of the same<br />pattern at different hierarchical abstraction levels).<br /><br />The Memory-Prediction Framework<br />Intelligence is measured by the capacity to remember and<br />predict patterns in the world.<br />Your brain receives patterns from the outside world, stores<br />them as memories, and makes predictions by combining<br />what it has seen before and what is happening now. Your<br />perception of the world is intimately tied to prediction.<br />Correct predictions result in understanding, whereas<br />incorrect predictions result in confusion. If predictions are<br />violated the brain will notice.<br />Figure: “The past is a memory, the future an expectation. Neither past<br />nor future actually exist. There is only a continuum Now.” Alan Watts.<br /><br />How it works<br />Large-scale relationships are stored at the top of hierarchy<br />(fewer changes over time) and small-scale relationships<br />(details) are stored toward the bottom.<br />Each region tries to interpret its stream of inputs as part of<br />a know sequence of patterns.<br />An unexpected pattern is automatically passed to the next<br />higher cortical region until something will interpret it.<br />The observed patterns propagate up the hierarchy and<br />predictions flow down the hierarchy.<br />The learning forms in higher regions of the cortex and then<br />they move down hierarchy until they become reflexes (like<br />driving a car or practising a sport).<br />That’s why younger brains are slow to recognize inputs<br />while on the other hand experts have their representations<br />re-formed on lower levels of the cortex.<br /><br />Evolution of brain<br />Simple organisms ! DNA sequence = brain memory.<br />Plants ! slow chemical-based communications systems.<br />Humans ! fast neurons but size makes the difference.<br />Language is the only way of transferring knowledge.<br />Prediction by analogy is like judgement by stereotype.<br />“Culture is your operating system. [...] Our current operating<br />system works on low sampling rate which is what creates<br />stereotypes. This makes everyone appear alike when in fact<br />the glory is in everyone’s differences. The current operating<br />system is flawed, it actually has bugs in it that generates<br />contradictions. Contradictions such as we are cutting the earth<br />beneath our own feat, we are poising our own atmosphere that<br />we breath. This is a not intelligent behaviour ! This is a culture<br />with a bug in it’s operating system.” - Terence McKenna<br /><br />Creativity and Consciousness<br />Stereotyping is an inherent feature of the brain. Avoid false<br />stereotypes being skeptical and empathetic.<br />Creativity = making uncommon analogies and predictions.<br />If correct correlations cannot be found, the brain is more<br />happy to accept false ones. Pseudo-science, bigotry, faith<br />and intolerance are often rooted in false analogy.<br />Consciousness = what it feels like to have a cortex =<br />awareness and the capacity to experience.<br />A Scientific American article, The Astonishing Hypotheses,<br />by Francis Crick ! The mind is the creation of the brain.<br />The Ego is a creation of the mind. “Your greatest enemy...<br />is your own inner perception, is your own ignorance, is<br />your own ego.” - Dr. Obadiah Harris.<br /><br />Phylosophical implications<br />The brain is in a quiet dark box. It knows the world only<br />through the nerve fibres.<br />“We never know the noumenon (the thing in itself) but just<br />the phenomenon (the experience)” - Immanuel Kant.<br />“Matter is not made of matter.” - Hans Peter D¨ urr.<br />There isn’t any clear distinction where the body ends end<br />where the rest of the world begins.<br />We feel to have an independent mind because the mind<br />cannot build a model of the brain itself.<br />We all see reality differently. Different religious beliefs<br />learned early in life can lead to different models of morality.<br />Clearly all these models cannot be all true in some<br />absolute sense.<br /><br />Future of intelligence<br />Problems<br />Capacity: it has to be huge (80 HDDs).<br />Connectivity: highly connected (millions / axon).<br />Memristor<br />New (2008); two-terminal variable resistor (resistance<br />dependent upon the amount of charge).<br />Huge density = 100Gbits<br />cm2 and have inherent properties of<br />the neurons (strengthening and inhibition).<br />Connected in a grid but they can share wires (multiplexing).
