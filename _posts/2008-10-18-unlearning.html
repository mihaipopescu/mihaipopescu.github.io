The western philosopher, explains with freshness and lucidity the way of Tao "which is not the eternal Tao". Using a more digestible language he is a venerable pioneer in bringing the Eastern philosophy and understanding into the westerner's point of view.<br /><br />On the other hand, our science got to a point where we can completely eliminate the need of God and basically science has it's own religion. Watts also promotes "The religion of NO religion" and that doesn't mean that he promotes atheism. He says only that one must seek inward for self enlightenment not outward for a particular God. Inward you'll find the only God there is and that is You and Everybody and Everything else.<br /><br />In the last century, science with the help of computers discovered fractals. They are beautiful mathematical objects and simply you have to gaze at them because it's useless to try to comprehend them. They are infinitely complex as everything in this world; from the smallest particle (still undiscovered) to the edge of space-time (still not determined). Finding fractals everywhere creates a new ground for the Philosophy of Science, which is the <span style="font-style: italic;">Fractal Tao</span>.<br /><br />To enter in this new frame of mind we have to unlearn things we've learned. Lao Tzu said: "The scholar learns something every day, a man of a Tao unlearns something everyday, until he gets back to non-doing." Unlearning things makes you boundless, but it's hard to stop thinking as it's hard to calm a disturbed water with our hands. So we have to let go and be carried out by the flow and eventually reach that state with no effort.
