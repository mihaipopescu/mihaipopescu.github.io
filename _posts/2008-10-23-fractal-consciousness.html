We live in a world of illusion. We think about matter as something very solid but in fact matter is not solid at all. It consists of atoms surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The solidity results from the repulsing electrical interaction between the atoms. Quantum physics had shown that if we go deeper and deeper in structure of atoms we enter in a world of pure abstraction and pure potential. This is thought to be the information field governed by consciousness and thus our minds can alter the Universe.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ec-DekKhGHQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ec-DekKhGHQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Max Planck was talking about God, the consciousness being that expresses itself through all living beings, through all matter and all the Universe. He is not separated from us. It's like the Universe is a very complex fractal. Because in a fractal the part resembles the whole, if we have consciousness then matter has it too and this might bee the only substance there is.<br /><br /><blockquote>"I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.<span style="font-style: italic;">" Max Planck - </span><i>The Observer</i> (January 25th, 1931)</blockquote><br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VfdUrGTSFls&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VfdUrGTSFls&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />"The circle has an inside and an outside which are different (separate) and cannot exist without the other. To a donut the inside and the outside is the same." So we see that when we think in a higher dimensions things seem to be one. We think to ourselves separate from everything else because we perceive world through our senses and project these holograms outside ourselves. But the reality is that we are all one and thus this feeling of separateness is the matrix of life.<br /><br />That's why LOVE is the most powerfull force of the Universe. Because it disolves the feeling of being alone and binds people. Jesus knew this from the Beginning and we all knew this, we only have to remember.
