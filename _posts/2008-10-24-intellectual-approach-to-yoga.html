It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism." - 1945, from "<span style="font-style: italic;">Albert Einstein: The Human Side</span>", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffmanm Princeton University Press</blockquote>
