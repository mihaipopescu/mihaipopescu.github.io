For Alan Watts making philosophy it is a way of living. He once joked in an open talk: <blockquote>A philosopher nowadays is a practical fellow that comes with a briefcase at nine and leaves at five. He does philosophy during the day which is discussing whether sentences have meaning and if so what, and then he would come to work in a white coat if he could get away with it.<br /><br /></blockquote>When he talks about eastern philosophy he does it from a neutral point of view and that's it's clearly stated in "The Way of Zen" where he writes: <blockquote>On the one hand, it is necessary to be sympathetic and to experiment personally with the way of life to the limit of one's possibilities. On the other hand, one must resist every temptation to "join the organization", to become involved with its institutional commitments. In this friendly neutral position one is apt to be disowned by both sides.<br /><br /></blockquote><embed id=VideoPlayback src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=1639135737315939186&hl=en&fs=true style=width:400px;height:326px allowFullScreen=true allowScriptAccess=always type=application/x-shockwave-flash> </embed><br /><br /><br />In the previous video you saw that time is relative. We three-dimensional beings see the 4th dimension in a distorted way. Time/space is relative to the observer point of view and thus: if there is no observer is no time nor space. Let's see now the scientific explanation of the shape of the time.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/y53hh-LAbLk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/y53hh-LAbLk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><ol><li>All events are really one event.</li><li>Time is pair-shaped and relative to the observer. </li><li>We cannot observe the present we are only seeing the past. </li></ol>So it's very hard to define the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRESENT</span>, because it's changing, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAST, </span>because our memory is selective, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUTURE</span> which is an expectation.
