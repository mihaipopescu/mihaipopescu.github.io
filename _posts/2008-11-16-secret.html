We saw that through meditation we are making a conscious attempt to stop thinking, but most of the time we think. We have to control our daily thinking as much as we advance in our non-thinking training.<br /><br />In eastern philosophy we have <span style="font-weight: bold;">Karma Yoga</span> and it basically means <span style="font-weight: bold;">Action</span>. In Karma Yoga everything that is happening to you <span style="font-style: italic;">it's your own doing </span>and not just because <span style="font-style: italic;">"We are one",</span> we are literally attract the future events with our thinking. Stopping thinking enables us to enter in a timeless space. Watch <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Secret"</span> movie and see what laws exist at consciousness level.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_b1GKGWJbE8&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_b1GKGWJbE8&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
