This is the Yin&amp;Yang of existence.<br /><br />All that we know exist in contrast with it's respective opposite. So people are tented to split the world in black and white, wright and wrong, beautiful and ugly, etc. and then expect of life only the good part. But we see that if there was only white in this world you couldn't see nothing except white and the Universe will be very boring. There must be some black to see the white. <br /><br />On the other hand, astrophysicists found that the Universe is filled more with Dark Matter than with Matter and it couldn't have been created without the existence of Dark Matter. <br /><br />So all negative things-events coexist with the positive and you could not have one without the other. Now let Alan Watts explain more on this:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nQJoCTZUPrk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed> </object><br /><br /><blockquote>Nothing is more fertile than emptiness.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Alan Watts</span></blockquote>
