We have been cultivated with beliefs in our culture that shape our entire civilization. We bought our belief in the Darwinian Theory that says that we got here through random mutations and genetic accidents. There is no purpose for us of begin here on this planet because we are an accident. We are in an eternal struggle for survival, competition of being the fittest. So we have to compete against each other in order to get our piece of life out of this. So this is where we are right now, when we destroy ourselves through wars, famine and even when we destroy our environment.<br /><br />Another harmful thing that we are doing to ourselves is when we are under stress. There are three side effects when stress hormones are released and they are related to the blood flow.<br /><ol><li>the blood is concentrated more for the protection system and the immune systems is shut down</li><li>growth and regeneration systems are shut down because they are less important than dealing with the stress source</li><li>the blood vessels from the frontal lobes, that are responsible for thinking, or reasoning, are constricted and the blood is directed to the back of the head where instinctual behavior resides.</li></ol><br />This is not saying that stress is not good. It's good when we have to deal with immediate threat like being chased by a tiger. Nowadays we are dealing more with other kind of stress. For example, when we are under stress at work, we have to work more, better and faster in order to get that thing done. People who loose their jobs and are in debt because they cannot longer pay the loan, their stress can even push them towards suicide. But this stress is superficial by it's nature. It's a stress that we are creating in our minds, but it has the same effects like the real one. This is the biology of perception and it's explained by PhD. Bruce Lipton.<br /><br /><object width="480" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hLZ7GqWpEqM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hLZ7GqWpEqM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="390"></embed></object><br /><br />We live in a world with 360 degree of stress and the only way to deal with it is just to step outside of it, don't engage to it and be disconnected. It's the way eastern thought of non-engagement to what we call "real world" but for them is Maya or the illusion. When one realize that the world is just an illusion your stress hormones that were supposed to protect are not triggered anymore in artificial situations.<br /><br />Cells are like people. They have all the systems that we have: respiratory, digestive, reproduction, endocrine and even immune system. Cells are a community, they have jobs, cells get paid for their jobs, there is an economy, there is a politics and they leave in harmony. The answer lies within. We live in a fractal universe where patterns repeat themselves in a similar fashion at every level.<br /><br />Genetic control is what we have been programmed, which literally means that we are controlled by genes that we inherited. This concept basically makes us somehow are a victim impotent of changing our biology, it's like sitting in a back sit of a car, where the car is our body and genes are the driver.<br /><br />In epi-genetics, the body is not controlled by the genes, but is something else that is controlling the genes (that where the "epi" comes from, something external). And that something is nothing else except our mind. The genes control nothing, the genes are only the blueprint for our body. The DNA represents the blueprint and the nervous system is the contractor that constantly modifies the blueprint according to the environment in order to keep the body alive.<br /><br />So with the new view from epi-genetics, the mind controls the biology of the body. If we are able to control our minds we would be able to control our body too. This idea relates to the <a href="http://fractaltao.blogspot.com/2008/11/secret.html">"Law of Attraction"</a> that says that whatever you are thinking you are attracting that thing if you truly believe in it. But this is like when you would have an endless supply of desire in you, and whatever happens you are not put down by any event until you will actually going to achieve or have that thing.<br /><br />Buddha said that desire is the source of all sufferings in the world. So Buddhist monks went out and cut desire, eliminated desire from all of their being, thrown desire, killed all desire within them. After all this effort they went back to Buddha and but the Buddha said "No, now you desire not to desire". So it's like a vicious circle. There is nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />But how can one be able to control his mind ? What does he must do in order to improve his mind so to be in control of it, when he is using as a tool his own mind ? The mind cannot be the subject and the object of the improvement at the same time. This is like biting your own teeth or feeling the tip of your finger with the tip of your finger. You simply cannot do it. Then you realize that you cannot do anything about it. There is only though meditation one can become aware of this and experience the world just like it is, with good and bad, accepting them as they come.
