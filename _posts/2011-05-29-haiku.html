It was triggered by a flash of memory from my childhood spent in the beautiful mountains of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukovina">Bukovina</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>This is the simplest and the most sophisticated form of literature in the world. It is as if it were a work not of art but of nature. <br />- <i>Alan Watts</i></blockquote><br />Haiku is awakening the anticipation but it's left unfinished. The reader has the same amount of contribution to the poem as the writer. The art is knowing when to stop, when enough have been said.<br /><br /><blockquote>Everything that is formulated it is as intensity decayed.<br /><i>Emil Cioran</i><br /></blockquote><br />Haiku poems are characterized by simplicity, lack of unessential and directness. It involves no symbolism, the point being more obvious. The thing that we are all looking for is just in front our eyes but we cannot see it because we look in other obscure places.
