<p>This description is an image of myself that is made of some salient features whereby people can recognize me. But this is just a caricature of myself, like a skeleton made only from bones with no flesh on them. The concept of myself should include the whole psychophysical organism, conscious and unconscious plus my environment.</p>

<p>Now I play the role of a software engineer working at <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> in Copenhagen. I can play other roles but I find this one is best for making a living. I can assure you that this is just a mask and I don't take it seriously. The real me is who I am now and that already has changed.</p>
